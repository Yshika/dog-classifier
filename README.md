# Dog-Classifier

In this project, I have build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can classify the breed of dog from any given image. If the image is of a human and not of a dog, then the algorithm will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling otherwise if it is of neither dog nor human then it will tell the same.

The code is written in Python 3 and Keras with Tensorflow backend all presented in Jupyter Notebook. I used AWS EC2 gpu instance for training the model.
